# Lint clippy::absolute_paths
#
# Checks for usage of items through absolute paths, like std::env::current_dir.
#
# Many codebases have their own style when it comes to importing, but one that is seldom used is using absolute paths everywhere.
# 
# This is generally considered unidiomatic, and you should add a use statement.
# 
# The default maximum segments (2) is pretty strict, you may want to increase this in clippy.toml.
# Note: One exception to this is code from macro expansion - this does not lint such cases, as using absolute paths is the proper way of referencing items in one.
